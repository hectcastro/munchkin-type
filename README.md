An interactive web application that displays alphanumeric characters as they are typed.

## Getting Started

First, enable JavaScript and Sass compilation on changes:

```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm site
```

Afterwards, use something like Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` to serve the compiled changes:

```bash
$ python -mSimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```
